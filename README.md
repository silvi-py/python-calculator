# 🧮 Calculator Projects - SILVESTAR CHURENSKI

Hello, I'm Silvestar Churenski, a 16-year-old who has just stepped into the world of software development. I live in Germany, go to school, and also try to improve myself in the IT field. On the one hand, I'm looking for an apprenticeship (Ausbildung) that I can lean towards.

This is my first GitHub project. As I said, my short-term desire is to find an Ausbildung, learn, focus on an area, and improve myself.

In the long term, it's currently AI/ML Engineering/Data Science.

## 📚 About the Project

This repo contains calculators I developed with two different technologies:

1. **Web Calculator** - with HTML, CSS, JavaScript
2. **Python Calculator** - with Python and Tkinter

## 🎯 Learning Goals

- Learn basic programming concepts
- Experience different technologies
- Learn how to use GitHub
- Create a portfolio

## 🚀 Future Plans

- Develop AI/ML projects
- Advance in the field of data science
- Contribute to open source projects

*"Every expert was once a beginner. With this first step I take today, I am on my way to becoming tomorrow's AI engineer."*
