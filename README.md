# Calculator Projects

Hello, I am Silvestar Churenski, a 16-year-old living in München, Germany. This is my first real project that I have shared on GitHub. I started learning programming a few months ago and I'm still a school goer I'm currently trying to find an Ausbildung in the fields I'm interested in, software is one of the flours because I really want to get better at it. and improve myself day by day
## What's in here

I built two simple calculators to practice:
- **Web Calculator** - made with HTML, CSS and JavaScript
- **Python Calculator** - made with Python and Tkinter

They both do the same thing - basic math operations. Nothing fancy but they work and I learned a lot making them.

## How to use it

**For the web version:**
Just download `index.html` and open it in your browser
You can use the live HTML version through this link:
https://silvi-py.github.io/python-calculator/

**For the Python version:**
You need Python installed, then just run:
```
python calculator.py
```

## What I learned

- How to handle user input
- Making buttons actually do something
- Basic arithmetic in code
- How to make things look decent (dark theme!)
- Git and GitHub (still figuring this out honestly)

## What's next

I want to keep building more projects and get better at coding. Maybe next I'll try something with APIs or a to-do app. We'll see.

If you have any feedback or tips, feel free to let me know!
